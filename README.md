# Google Maps Game
This is a simple game made with react and the Google maps API. \
Decided to make this project because i wanted to learn about the Google Maps API, and ended up developing a nice mini game.

## How To Run
cd to client directory and run npm install, and then run "npm start" to run the app:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

## Game Rules
- In each turn, you will be required to find on the map the location of israeli settlements.
- The distance in km you had from the settlement, will be added to your score. This
- You will have 5 turns in total, and you should try and get the **lowest score possible**.
- You also start the game having one clue, and if you succeed in finding the target settlement (20 km or less), you will be given another clue.
